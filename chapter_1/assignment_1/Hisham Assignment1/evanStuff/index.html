        was an American musician whose work 
        included R&B, rock, soul, funk, and 
        gospel. Preston was a top session 
        keyboardist in the 1960s, during which 
        he backed artists such as Little 
        Richard, Sam Cooke, Ray Charles, and 
        the Beatles. He then went on to achieve fame 
        as a solo artist, with hit pop singles 
        including "That's the Way God Planned 
        It", "Outa-Space", "Will It Go Round in 
        Circles", "Space Race", and "Nothing from 
        Nothing". Additionally, Preston co-wrote 
        "You Are So Beautiful", which became a number 
        5 hit for Joe Cocker; Stephen Stills asked Preston 
        if he could use his phrase "if you can't be with the 
        one you love, love the one you're with" and created 
        the hit song.
